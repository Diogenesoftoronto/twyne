  Suffix appended to the room-of-editors user prompt when a single persona
  is being asked to score the draft on the /personas rubric. Adds the
  JUDGE TASK header and the JSON response shape.
version: "1"

JUDGE TASK: As {personaName}, give the draft a single integer score from 1 to 10. A score of 5 means "the draft is doing the work for the stated audience and goal but has clear, fixable issues." A score of 7 means "the draft is in good shape and the issues are minor." A score of 9 means "publishable as-is." Be honest; most first drafts are in the 3-5 range.

Do not reward confident-sounding bullshit. Penalize generic filler, repeated paragraphs, unsupported universal claims, vibes without evidence, fake specificity, and any passage that sounds polished while dodging the stated audience/goal.

Respond as JSON, and only JSON, in this exact shape:
{"score": <integer 1-10>, "rationale": "<one sentence, your voice>"}
